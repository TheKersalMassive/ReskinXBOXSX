## How I do get Source (Launcher) label on the game cover?
These are based on the **'Source'** field, if you want to show 'Steam', 'Ubisoft Connect' or 'Epic' as in the above screenshots, you will need to set these sources in the source field of your game(s).

You must ensure you have the following Sources assigned to a game Playnite:
```
Amazon Games
Battle.net
EA Play
Epic
GOG
Origin
Rockstar Games
Steam
Ubisoft Connect
Windows
XBOX 
XCloud
```

To open the theme installation folder go to:
*Add-ons (F9) > Installed > Themes Fullscreen > Reskin PS5 > Installation Folder*

## I don't see an icon or label that I want?
You have two options:

1. You can create an icon and place it in ***\Icons\Filters*** for Icons or ***\Icons\Sources*** or Source labels in the theme folder
- However you will need to backup your icons as every time the theme is updated it will overwrite the icons in that folder

2. You can raise a request for a new icon/source/logo **[here](https://github.com/TheKersalMassive/ReskinXBOXSX/issues)**
- Create a **New Issue** and/or attach your icon if you want it added to the theme. Each icon submission will be reviewed and needs to match the general scheme and aesthtic of the theme

## How do I get a custom colour border?

Note: Custom border colours only work if you have one single tag assigned to a game

1. In Desktop Mode, right click on your game(s) and click on ***Set Category***

2. Create a new category **Reskin** or Assign it if already created:

3. Edit your game(s) and add a *'Tag'* of the colour you want for your game(s).
- For example, I want a red border, so I add a **Red** tag:

You can choose from the below colours as tags:

## Can you add support for any extensions or add-ons?
No as I don't use any extensions, plugins or add-ons. However, you can always mod the theme if you prefer.


## I want to show game logos in the Game Details view
You can either add game logos as an icon or you can use Extra Metadata Loader addon **[here](https://playnite.link/forum/thread-814.html)**
